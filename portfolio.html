        <p class="lead">Thomas is a developer who has always had an interest and passion for tech.

Two computers later, and he is still using the excitement from that first MacBook Pro to learn new languages and new technologies daily. With a diverse work history in Tech, Sales and Management he would be a great fit for any organization looking for someone with strong leadership skills, a developed understand of a bredth of technologies, and a refined set of sales skills.
